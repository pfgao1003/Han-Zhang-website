					Meteor Shower (pinyin: Yīqǐ Lái Kàn Liúxīngyǔ) is a 2009 Chinese television series which starring Hans Zhang, Yu Haoming, Vision Wei and Zhu Zixiao. 
					It premiered on Hunan TV on August 8, 2009. Due to the success and popularity of Japanese manga Hana Yori Dango and its franchise 
					(Meteor Garden, Hana Yori Dango and Boys Over Flowers), Hunan TV decided to create a new series based on the same name. 
					It is an unlicensed live-television drama production not authorized by Japanese publisher Shueisha. 
					According to the producer, the series is only inspired by the manga and not based on it.
					The series attracted various controversies since its premiere. 
					It was criticized for blatant plagiarism of Boys Over Flowers 
					(through its Taiwanese adaptation Meteor Garden), excessive product placement, 
					as well as its old-fashioned costumes and dialogues. Viewers also panned the inconsistent 
					plot and poor characters development of the series. Despite the negative reviews, 
					the series was extremely popular during its run and contributed to the rise of idol dramas 
					in Mainland China.

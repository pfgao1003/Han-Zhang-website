		<h1>Pengfei (Alex) Gao</h1>
		<p>
			Hey! I'm Alex, an EECS master student at University of Michigan. I have 4 years coding experience
			and hands-on experience of full-stack development. I have 3 software engineer internship experience. 
			In summer 2022, I interned at Modern Treasury, a fintech unicorn at SF as a full-stack software engineer intern.
			My technology stacks are Python, Java, Ruby on Rails for back-end, Typescript / Javascript (React, Angular) for
			front-end, GraphQL and SQL for query language, and MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite for database.

		</p>
		<p>
			I'm passionate about taking ownership and working on high impact projects. Throughout my past experiences,
			I have always felt a sense of joy and satisfation as new features were deployed - sometimes built by myself,
			sometimes built by my colleagues, and far often times a result of collegial efforts. I consider myself a very curious
			individual, always fascinated by new ideas and wanting to learn from others. I'm excited at the prospect of working in an environment where there
			is a mentoring and collaborative culture.

				Zhang Han was born in Qiqihar, Heilongjiang. He entered the Central Academy of Drama and majored in acting in 2003. 
				Even though he had always wanted to be an actor, Hans was not a very confident person at the starting phase of his career and doubted his own acting skills. 
				Also, he was not too comfortable about nudity or sexuality in front of the camera. 
				This led to a bit of confusion about his career choice in his own mind. 
				However, it was a video that he had himself made which landed him in the middle of all attention. 
				The romantic short video earned him a major fan following as well as a handful of positive reviews which made him confident about his acting skills, 
				and eventually he decided to stick with his desire to be an actor. 
				Hans has featured in many television shows and has acted in several films. 
				Interestingly, over the course of his acting career he also got opportunities to showcase his 
				singing talent and provided vocals for the soundtracksof several television shows in which he 
				worked as an actor.
